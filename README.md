# Flashcards app
## BRAINLY | Internship challenge

Create a single page flashcard webapp that loads data from external URL. Flashcards should be
presented as cards (one at a time) with questions and two answers (only one of them is valid). For
each flashcard user should be able to choose one of the answers. Choosing invalid answer
should move card to the end of the deck, and valid answer removes card from the deck. After
adding correct answer to all questions users should get feedback on their performance.
All the details that are not specified above are left for the developer to decide.
